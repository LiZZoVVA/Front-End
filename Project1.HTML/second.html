    <h3><p>This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have.<br>

    scent chemicals! Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and then they<br>
    lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.</p></h3>
